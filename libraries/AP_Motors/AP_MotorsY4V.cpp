FRAME_ORIENTATION  Direction of the V-tail (up or down)
                Y4V_V_TAIL  Tail motors tilted inward ("V"-shaped)
                Y4V_A_TAIL  Tail motors tilted outward (upside-down V is an "A") 

Frame parameters that determine motor behaviour. For anything not too far off from the defaults, it will behave well
without changing these values, but they do matter for "perfect tuning"

Y4V_TAIL_WIDTH  Width between tail props as fraction of "main width" (distance between front props),
                measured perpendicular to the motor axis. This value will depend a lot on tail design (height, width, tilt).
                It is used to determine the tail props leverage on roll.

Y4V_TAIL_ANGLE  Tail motor tilt angle from vertical, in degrees (0 - 90)

Y4V_YAW_FACTOR  Yaw effect of a propellers rotation as fraction of its "pull force"
                Assuming some proportional relation between frame and prop size, this should not vary too much.

Y4V_COG         Center of gravity. The crafts center of gravity along the main axis. 0 = all the way forward,
                1 = all the way back. 1/3rd is the default for tricopters and is used here too, but since the
                two tail props will usually have more lift than a single one (but less than two horizontal props),
                it can be moved back a bit.

    //fraction of that.
