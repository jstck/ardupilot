These defines are set in config.h, can be overridden in APM_Config.h

Y4V_TAIL - Direction of the V-tail (up or down)
Y4V_V_TAIL - Tail motors tilted inward ("V"-shaped)
Y4V_A_TAIL - Tail motors tilted outward (upside-down V is an "A")


Y4V_TAIL_WIDTH - Width between tail rotors as fraction of "main width"


Y4V_TAIL_ANGLE - Tail motor tilt angle from vertical, in degrees

Y4V_YAW_FACTOR - Yaw effect of a propellers momentum as fraction of its "pull force"
Assuming some proportional relation between frame and prop size, this should not vary too much.

    //The frames are set up so these two factors work together in the tail motors to yaw the copter, so they're summed up.

    //work anyway to compensate for the roll of the tail so it might as well be included.
